*** Things I want to cover in different branches:

- Can I use the same client for multiple calls?

- Can I register different services on the same connection?

- Is it true that if I forward a message passing by a middleware server that has an older version of the proto, the new fields will be propagated anyway?

- Context propagation: metadata, cancelation

- Service discovery example with etcd

- Authorization

- Interceptors : implement retry policy, test with opentracing / opencensus
